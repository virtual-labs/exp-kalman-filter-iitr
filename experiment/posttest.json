  {
    "question": "What is the effect of choosing an initial state covariance that is too low?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "The filter will ignore all measurements",

    "question": "How can initial conditions of the Kalman filter be optimized for better prediction performance?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "By setting all initial values to zero",

    "question": "Can the initial state estimate (x0_est) be changed, and what effect does it have on the Kalman filter simulation?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "No, it must always be [0; 0]",
      "b": "Yes, it can be changed, and it affects the initial convergence and accuracy of the filter",
      "c": "No, changing it will cause the filter to fail",
      "d": "Yes, it can be changed, but it has no effect on the simulation"
